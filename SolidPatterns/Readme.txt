# Concepts

## Single responsibility principle
- a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).

## Open/closed principle[7]
- "software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov substitution principle[8]
- "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

## Interface segregation principle[9]
- "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]

## Dependency inversion principle[10]
- one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4]
